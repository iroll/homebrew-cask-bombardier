Bombardier
==========
Bombardier is The GNU Bombing utility

For compilation gcc and ncurses development files should be enough.

USAGE:
    You can use SPACE to bomb and 'p' or 'P' to pause.
    You can quit with 'q' or 'Q'!
    You can set speed with 1 to 9, 1 is the slowest and 9 is the fastest!

Check out the manpage too (bombardier.6)!

      He gave me the original idea of console games, and he found the
      moon-buggy in debian potato.  For lot of testing and bug reports
