Bombardier
==========

Bombardier is The GNU Bombing utility ;)

It is an extremely great game. You can play it with a simple UNIX account, 
this can be any POSIX unix which support ncurses. But the game is only
tested with Linux until now.

HEY! We have to say that Windows NT, Windows 95 and other trademarks or
products of Microsoft Corporation are not POSIX Unixes anyway ;)
If anyone will compile this software for these peace of fantastic softwares,
he will get to the hell...

USAGE:
    You can use SPACE to bomb and 'p' or 'P' to pause.
    You can quit with 'q' or 'Q'!
    You can set speed with 1 to 9, 1 is the slowest and 9 is the fastest!
